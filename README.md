# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Python mini projects
created to practice core Python concepts and improve logical thinking
through hands-on coding.

## Projects

- Hello World  
  A basic Python script written to understand the structure of a Python
  program and how output works.

- Calculator  
  A menu-driven command-line calculator that allows users to perform
  basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division with proper input handling.
  Supports modulus (%) operation. The program also handles invalid input
  and provides a clean exit option for better user experience.

- Number Guessing Game  
  A console-based Python game where the computer randomly selects
  a number and the user tries to guess it within a limited number
  of attempts. The program provides hints to guide the user.Includes
  an option to replay the game without restarting the program.

- Password Generator  
  A simple command-line password generator built using Python.
  The program generates a random password based on the length
  provided by the user and includes letters, numbers, and symbols.
  It also validates the input length and reminds users to keep
  their passwords secure.

- To-Do List (CLI)  
  A simple command-line to-do list application that allows users
  to add, view, and remove tasks.This project was created to practice
  list operations, loops, and basic user interaction in Python.


- Contact Book (CLI)  
  This is a simple command-line contact book application written in Python.
  It helps users store and manage contact details like name and phone number.
  Users can add new contacts, view all saved contacts, search for a contact
  by name, and delete contacts when they are no longer needed. The program
  also checks for duplicate contact names to avoid adding the same contact
  more than once.

- Quiz App (CLI)  
  This is a simple command-line quiz application written in Python.
  The program asks multiple-choice questions and calculates the final
  score based on the user’s answers. If the user selects a wrong option,
  the correct answer is displayed to help with learning. This project
  was created to practice lists, loops, and basic conditional logic.

- Temperature Converter (CLI)  
  A simple command-line temperature converter written in Python.
  The program allows users to convert values between Celsius and
  Fahrenheit based on their choice. This project was created to
  practice conditional statements, functions, and user input handling.

- Dice Rolling Simulator (CLI)  
  This is a simple command-line dice rolling simulator written in Python.
  The program generates a random number between 1 and 6 each time the user
  chooses to roll the dice. Users can roll the dice multiple times or exit
  the program whenever they want. This project was created to practice
  random number generation, loops, and basic user input handling in Python.

## What I Learned
Through these mini projects, I practiced writing simple Python programs
using functions, loops, lists, and dictionaries. I also learned how to
handle user input, validate data, and improve programs step by step
based on new requirements.
