# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly Python mini projects
created to practice core Python concepts and improve logical thinking
through hands-on coding.

## Projects

- Hello World  
  A basic Python script written to understand the structure of a Python
  program and how output works.

- Calculator  
  A menu-driven command-line calculator that allows users to perform
  basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division with proper input handling.
  Supports modulus (%) operation. The program also handles invalid input
  and provides a clean exit option for better user experience.

- Number Guessing Game  
  A console-based Python game where the computer randomly selects
  a number and the user tries to guess it within a limited number
  of attempts. The program provides hints to guide the user.Includes
  an option to replay the game without restarting the program.

- Password Generator  
  A simple console-based Python program that generates
  a random password based on the length entered by the user.
  It uses letters, numbers, and symbols to create strong passwords.
  and also reminds the user to keep the generated password secure.

- To-Do List (CLI)  
  A simple command-line to-do list application that allows users
  to add, view, and remove tasks.This project was created to practice
  list operations, loops, and basic user interaction in Python.


- Contact Book (CLI)  
  A simple command-line contact book application that allows users
  to store contact details such as name and phone number. Users can
  add new contacts, view all saved contacts, search for a specific
  contact by name, and delete unwanted contacts. This project was
  created to practice list and dictionary usage along with basic
  menu-driven program logic in Python.
